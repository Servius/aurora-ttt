Thank you for purchasing the TTT Realistic Booby Trap!


  To install this addon:
    > Extract or Drag&Drop the 'ttt_realistic_boobytrap' folder into your 'addons' folder. ( ex: c:/srcds/steampipe/garrysmod/addons/ )

  PM me for any assistance installing. 
  The swep comes fully configured but there are a few small adjustments you can make if your so inclined.   
  See the config file for more information. The configuration file is:
    > ttt_realistic_boobytrap/lua/ttt_boobytrap_config.lua


This swep also comes provided with custom icons to match default TTT sweps.
To create your own icon to match a particular shop theme, we have included a cutout of the swep to use with your template. The icon resource is automatically added based on the configuration file, and assumes the material asset is in the 'materials' folder. 

This swep's models were designed in part thanks to Clavus' SWEP Construction Kit. Read more about his kit here:
